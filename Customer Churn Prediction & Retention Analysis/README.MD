Customer retention is more cost-effective than acquiring new customers — and churn directly impacts business revenue.
This internship project focuses on building a Customer Churn Prediction System using data analytics and machine learning to identify at-risk customers and recommend actionable retention strategies.

The project covers:
✔ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
✔ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
✔ Feature Selection
✔ Machine Learning Model Building
✔ Customer Risk Segmentation
✔ Business-Oriented Retention Recommendations

The goal is to help businesses reduce churn, improve customer satisfaction, and boost long-term profitability using data-driven insights.

📊 Customer Churn Prediction & Retention Analysis

Internship Project – Data Analytics & Machine Learning

⭐ Project Overview

This project was completed as part of my Data Analytics / Data Science internship.
I built a Customer Churn Prediction System using data analytics and machine learning to help businesses identify customers who are most likely to discontinue their services.

The goal of this project is not only to predict churn but also to understand why customers leave — and recommend data-driven retention strategies.

🎯 My Role & Contribution

During this internship, I independently handled the entire end-to-end workflow, including:

✅ Understanding the raw dataset
✅ Cleaning & preprocessing data
✅ Performing detailed EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)
✅ Feature selection & engineering
✅ Applying machine learning models
✅ Evaluating model performance
✅ Presenting insights and retention recommendations

This project helped me build confidence in real business problem-solving using data.

📂 What This Project Covers
1️⃣ Data Cleaning & Preparation

Removed missing & inconsistent values

Encoded categorical features

Standardized numerical variables

Prepared data suitable for ML modeling

2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visualized churn vs non-churn customers

Identified key churn drivers (tenure, charges, contract type)

Used charts & plots to explain patterns

Found customer segments with highest risk

3️⃣ Machine Learning Modeling

Tried multiple classification models

Compared accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score

Selected the best model based on real business needs

(In churn prediction, recall is more important than accuracy)

Created churn-risk segmentation for easy interpretation

4️⃣ Business Insights & Recommendations

Converted technical analysis into easy-to-understand business insights, such as:

Short-tenure customers churn the most

High monthly charges → higher risk of churn

Month-to-month contracts show the worst retention

Electronic payment failures increase cancellation likelihood

5️⃣ Retention Strategy Suggestions

These include:

Targeted discounts for high-risk customers

Loyalty benefits for long-term users

Improving onboarding for new customers

Flexible contracts & smoother payment experience

Personalized promotions based on customer behavior

🧰 Tools & Skills Demonstrated

Python, Jupyter Notebook

Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn

Matplotlib, Seaborn

Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest

Data Visualization

Feature Engineering

Business Problem Solving

Machine Learning Evaluation

🏆 Outcome of the Project

Built a working churn prediction model with high performance

Identified the top features that influence customer churn

Produced actionable insights for customer retention

Strengthened skills in analytics, modeling, and presentation

Completed a full end-to-end ML workflow independently

This project helped me understand how data analytics can directly support business growth and improve customer experience.

🚀 Why This Project Stands Out

It clearly shows your hands-on experience

It highlights your internship learning journey

It demonstrates both technical skills and business thinking

It is written in a way that HR, managers, and technical team can understand
